## MEDE Example Notebooks

This directory contains a range of example Jupyter notebooks (and associated data files) used in workshops and trainings for the MEDE-DSC.  Most of the notebooks are taken directly or are minor modifications of those publicly available on GitHub. Some were created de novo by MEDE-DSC folks. We have tried to keep references to original authors and links, but some examples are used so commonly that proper attribution can get lost.

The files are written to the base MEDE container image. Users may work with copies of the original files or pull new versions directly from the public GitHub repository at: [https://github.com/mededsc/mede_example_notebooks]().
